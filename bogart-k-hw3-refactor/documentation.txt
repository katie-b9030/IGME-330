II. I stuck with the basic trebel and bass nodes to add to the audio routing graph.

III. My sprite class name is SunflowerSprite, it draws a sunflower from the center and resizes it with the center audio value of the audioData.

IV. My av-data.json file contains the required title, track-files, and track-names, as well as instructions on how to run the app.

V. I improved my aesthetics by creating sunflowers and drawing better bars that resize from the center as the audio plays. I would say I deserve a 5/15 for improving my aesthetics.


HW-3 REFACTOR -----------------------------------------

I coded in Typescript for this homework.
    - I put the sunflower sprite into its own class file, the audio and main defaults into their own enum files, and the colorStops and drawParams into their own interface files.
    - All variables, function parameters, and function return types in each file are strongly typed according to typescript standards as necessary.
    - There are no errors or hints in any of the Typescript files
